# org-save

This code snippet provides two commands to save and capture with
org-mode at one go. It also adds key-bindings for these commands.

Usage: Put the script into your conkeror script folder. Call M-x
org-save (bound to M-S) if you want to save and capture the page or a
link, call M-x org-complete (bound to M-C) if you want to capture the
current page and save it with all its supporting documents.
